# Testing Instructions for Import/Export Feature

## Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **File Reading Error**: Fixed the "Unable to read the uploaded file" error
2. **toLowerCase() Error**: Fixed the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')" error
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and validation
4. **Field Requirements**: Updated to make only name field compulsory, all others optional

## How to Test

### Step 1: Test with CSV File
1. Open the `test-employees.csv` file in Excel or Google Sheets
2. Save it as an Excel file (.xlsx) with the name `test-employees.xlsx`
3. This will give you a proper Excel file to test with

### Step 2: Test Import Functionality
1. Go to your HR portal and navigate to the Employee Management section
2. Click the blue "Import" button
3. Upload the `test-employees.xlsx` file you created
4. The system should now:
   - Successfully read the file
   - Show a data preview
   - Display "File uploaded successfully" message
   - Show import summary with 5 valid records

### Step 3: Test Import Process
1. After successful file upload, click "Import Employees"
2. The system should:
   - Import all 5 employees to the database
   - Show "Import successful" message
   - Refresh the employee list
   - Close the import dialog

### Step 4: Test Template Export
1. Click the green "Template" button
2. This should download an Excel template file
3. Open the template and verify it has the correct column headers

### Step 5: Test Data Export
1. Click the amber "Export" button
2. This should download an Excel file with current employee data

## What Was Fixed

### 1. File Reading Issues
- Added proper error handling for FileReader
- Added validation for workbook and worksheet existence
- Added fallback column name mapping (supports both lowercase and proper case)
- Added better error messages with specific details

### 2. toLowerCase() Errors
- Added null/undefined checks before calling toLowerCase()
- Used optional chaining (?.) to prevent errors
- Added fallback empty strings for required fields

### 3. Data Processing
- Normalized column names to handle different Excel formats
- Added proper type casting for the row data
- Improved validation logic with better error handling

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Import
- File uploads without errors
- Data preview shows correctly
- Validation passes with 0 errors
- Import completes successfully
- New employees appear in the list

### Error Handling
- Invalid files show clear error messages
- Validation errors are displayed with row numbers
- Import is blocked until all errors are fixed
- State is properly reset on errors

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
2. **File Format**: Ensure the file is saved as .xlsx format
3. **Column Headers**: Make sure column names match the expected format
4. **Data Types**: Ensure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
5. **Email Format**: Ensure emails are valid format

## Test Data Included

The `test-employees.csv` file contains 5 test employees with:
- Valid email addresses
- Proper date formats
- Valid phone numbers
- Realistic salary and cost data
- Different departments and positions

This should provide a good test case for the import functionality.
